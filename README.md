# Dev Knowledge Hub

A compact, practical, and modern documentation hub for developer workflows, learning paths, and quick references.

This repo collects my notes, cheat sheets, tutorials, and hands-on guides across these major sections:

- **Mint-OS** — Linux setup, customizations, and dotfiles
- **Next.js Shortcut** — best libraries, patterns, and performance tips
- **AI & ML** — learning roadmaps, offline model setup, tools, and shortcuts
- **DSA** — C++ competitive programming resources and algorithm shortcuts
- **System Design** — architecture concepts, cheatsheets, and interview prep
- **Hacking** — ethical hacking labs, CTFs, tools, and privacy guidance

> Goal: Serve as a friendly starting point for newcomers, a quick-reference for practitioners, and a living playbook for my own growth.
